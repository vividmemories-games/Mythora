Product name: **Mythora**  
Source design: `Mythora_Gameplay_Design_v0.1.md` (formerly working title Relicbound)

## Genre

- Turn-based puzzle RPG
- Hero collection
- PvE adventure
- Live-service capable (phased)

## Core philosophy

The puzzle board **does not deal direct damage**.

The board generates **resources** that power hero skills. Combat revolves around:

- Limited **Moves**
- Resource management
- **Action Points (AP)**
- Hero skills
- (Later) team composition

Every turn should be a tactical decision, not “match the biggest combo.”

## Moves

- Every tile swap consumes **1 Move**
- Moves refresh at the start of every turn
- Moves **cannot** be carried over

Placeholder per-hero moves (Phase 1 stubs):

| Hero   | Moves |
|--------|------:|
| Knight | 4     |
| Mage   | 5     |
| Rogue  | 6     |
| Priest | 5     |

---

## Puzzle board

### Phase 1 board size

- First levels: **6×6 square**
- Later: asymmetric / irregular masks, disconnected regions, moving parts (Royal Match–style)

### Tile → resource mapping

| Tile   | Generates         |
|--------|-------------------|
| Red    | Attack Energy     |
| Blue   | Mana              |
| Green  | Healing           |
| Yellow | Shield            |
| Purple | Ultimate Energy   |

Matching tiles **never** deals damage directly. Matches fill resource meters.

Example: Match 4 Red → `+4 Attack Energy`

---

## Resources

Resources persist for the whole battle. Heroes specialize:

| Hero   | Primary resources |
|--------|-------------------|
| Knight | Red + Yellow      |
| Mage   | Blue + Purple     |
| Priest | Green + Blue      |
| Rogue  | Red + Purple      |

---

## Action Points (AP)

- Earned during battle (not refreshed each turn)
- Accumulates until spent
- Each hero has a max AP capacity

Placeholder generation (open for balancing):

- Every match = +1 AP
- 4-match = +2 AP
- Cascades may award bonus AP

---

## Hero skills

Every skill costs **both resources and AP**.

Examples:

| Skill        | Cost                         |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Basic Slash  | 4 Red + 1 AP                 |
| Fireball     | 8 Mana + 2 AP                |
| Heal         | 6 Healing + 1 AP             |
| Shield Wall  | 8 Shield + 2 AP              |
| Ultimate     | 20 Ultimate Energy + 5 AP    |

---

## Example turn

```text
Start Turn — Moves = 5, AP = 2
Match Red  — Moves = 4, Attack Energy +3, AP +1
Match Blue — Moves = 3, Mana +4, AP +1
Cast Fireball — spend 8 Mana + 2 AP
… until Moves = 0
Enemy Turn
```

---

## Enemy turn

Enemies may attack, buff, debuff, summon, apply status, or trigger boss mechanics.

Phase 1 stub: weighted skill table (see [Enemies](01_Game_Design/Enemies.md)). Numbers are placeholders for the Balancing Bible.

---

## Hero identity (Phase 1: single hero in battle)

| Hero   | Moves | Max AP | Role            |
|--------|------:|-------:|-----------------|
| Knight | 4     | 6      | Tank            |
| Mage   | 5     | 8      | Spell damage    |
| Rogue  | 6     | 4      | Fast damage     |
| Priest | 5     | 6      | Support / heal  |

**Locked:** battle uses **1 hero** for now. Parties / teams = Phase 3–4.

---

## Equipment

Equipment changes **rules**, not only raw stats.

Examples:

- Swift Boots → +1 Move
- Ruby Ring → +25% Attack Energy from Red matches
- Wizard Staff → Blue matches generate double Mana
- Lucky Charm → 15% chance to refund AP cost

---

## Boss mechanics

Bosses change rules / board, not only HP.

Examples:

- Ice Dragon → Lose 1 Move at start of every turn
- Spider Queen → Adds poison tiles
- Stone Golem → Immune until armor broken
- Necromancer → Summons skeletons every 3 turns
- Vampire Lord → Heals for 40% of damage dealt

---

## Match-3 mechanics to adopt (Royal Match–inspired)

Copy **mechanics**, not the full live-ops event calendar.

### Shape catalog → power-ups

| Formation | Power-up |
|-----------|----------|
| Line H/V of 3 | None (clear only) |
| Line **H of 4** | **Vertical rocket** (clears column) |
| Line **V of 4** | **Horizontal rocket** (clears row) |
| Line H/V of **5** | **Fireball** |
| **2×2 square** | **Bomb** (3×3) |
| Mix of five **T / plus** | **Bomb** |
| Mix of five **L** | **Seeker** (8 random tiles) |

New specials appear on the **swap destination**. Power-ups are **not color-matched** — activate by **tap** or by **swapping with any adjacent tile**. Special↔special swaps **merge** (see Decisions / engine).

**Fireball:** tap → clear a random color on the board; swap with a normal tile → clear that tile’s color. Power-ups among the cleared tiles **chain**.

**Bomb + V/H rocket:** both merges clear the same fat cross (3 full rows + 3 full columns centered on the merge).

- Cascades + gravity
- Later: more obstacles, irregular boards
- Layered / special obstacles with clear rules

**Defer:** weekly tournaments, streak gift ladders, renovation meta, seasonal event sprawl.

**MVP retention:** campaign + daily dungeon only.

## Design principles

1. Puzzle generates resources, not damage.
2. Moves are the player's turn budget.
3. Resources + AP power abilities.
4. Heroes feel unique through mechanics, not just stats.
5. Bosses change gameplay rules.
6. Systems create replayability; art stays manageable for a solo developer.

## Open design question

AP generation formula is intentionally soft until playtesting. Architecture above is fixed.
