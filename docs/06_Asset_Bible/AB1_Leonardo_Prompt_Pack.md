## 1. First session (10 minutes)

1. Sign up at [leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai).
2. Left sidebar → **AI Image Generation**.
3. **Private Mode** ON (paid plans).
4. Model: **Leonardo Phoenix**.
5. Style preset: **Illustration** (avoid **Dynamic**).
6. Alchemy ON for finals; OFF while exploring.
7. Attach style seed via Image Guidance (§1.1).
8. Sizes — table in §3.
9. Generate **4** while exploring; **1** for finals.

### 1.1 Bootstrap style seed (required)

Repo file:

`assets/images/style_board/style_seed_battle_mage.png`

**In Leonardo:**

1. **Image Guidance** → upload that PNG.
2. Type: **Style Reference** (not Character Reference on first board pass).
3. Strength: **High** for first mage/goblin board runs → **Mid** once consistent.
4. Paste §5.1 prompt + §2 negative → generate 4 → pick winner → `style_board_hero_mage.png`.
5. After mage board is approved, use **it** as Style Ref for goblin/tiles/heroes (seed is bootstrap only).

Do **not** use `style_seed_hero_mage_bust_deprecated.png`.

Reject: skin pores, adult proportions, cinematic busts, busy environments.

## 11. When output goes wrong


| Problem                           | Fix                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Too realistic / adult proportions | Style Ref @ High; add prompt `large head short body, chibi`; negative already bans adult proportions |
| Neon / cyberpunk                  | Strengthen negative; lower Style Ref slightly if palette warps                                       |
| Bust / head-and-shoulders only    | Add `full-body, feet visible near bottom`                                                            |
| Two characters                    | Negative `multiple characters`; generate 1 image                                                     |
| Text / HP bar in image            | Negative already includes; regenerate                                                                |
| Busy forest background            | Add `solid flat background deep teal #123A44 only`                                                   |
| Tile looks like different game    | Re-attach `style_board_tile_red.png`; match outline weight to characters                             |
| Style drift on enemy #4           | Re-attach goblin style board                                                                         |

## 12. Post-processing checklist

1. **Remove Background** (tiles, icons, VFX; sprites if bg isn’t clean teal)
2. **Crop** with ~10% margin; keep feet for full-body sprites
3. **Resize** to AB1 delivery sizes (sprites 512, tiles 256, skills 128)
4. **Rename** exactly per AB1 §6
5. Place in correct `assets/` folder
6. Squint test at phone size — reject if unreadable
7. Mark approved in `assets/images/style_board/README.md`

---



## 13. Training Dusk Chibi Element (optional, Premium+)

After 5 style-board images are approved:

1. **Training & Datasets** → New Dataset
2. Upload all 5 style-board PNGs (+ good same-session rejects, max ~15)
3. Name: `Mythora_Dusk_Chibi`
4. Train on platform-recommended base for Elements
5. Strength **0.55–0.70** characters; **0.45–0.55** tiles/icons

Style Reference alone is enough for Phase 1 if training isn’t worth the slot.
