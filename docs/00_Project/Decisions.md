# Decisions

Log material decisions here. Format: date, decision, reason, status.

Authority: product/engineering choices that override or clarify [PHASES](../PHASES.md) / [GAMEPLAY](../GAMEPLAY.md).

## 2026-07-10 — New Flutter app (not Dot Clash)

**Decision:** Build Mythora as a standalone Flutter app at `Documents/Personal Projects/Mythora`.

**Reason:** Different genre, identity, and Firebase project needs; reuse patterns only.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## 2026-07-10 — Combat model locked

**Decision:** Puzzle generates resources; skills cost resources + AP; Moves are the turn budget; then enemy turn. See [GAMEPLAY](../GAMEPLAY.md).

**Reason:** Core product differentiator vs match-3 that deals damage on match.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## 2026-07-10 — Phase 1 scope: 1 hero, 6×6, mock profile

**Decision:** Single hero in battle; first boards 6×6; mock/local profile until the loop feels good.

**Reason:** Prove feel before parties, Firebase, and content pipeline.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## 2026-07-10 — Cascade + no-match spawn

**Decision:** Boards spawn with zero matches. After a successful swap, resolve clear → gravity → spawn in a loop until stable. Cascades grant resources/AP; only the player swap spends a Move.

**Reason:** Leftover on-board matches and in-place refill felt broken.

**Status:** Accepted — implemented in `PuzzleEngine` / `BattleNotifier`

---

## 2026-07-10 — Weighted enemy skill stubs

**Decision:** Enemies pick from weighted skills (e.g. Goblin: Nick / Slash / Heavy Swing). Numbers are Phase 1 stubs for the [Balancing Bible](../01_Game_Design/Balancing_Bible.md).

**Reason:** Flat damage every turn felt lifeless; full AI/balance deferred to Phase 2.

**Status:** Accepted — stub in `EnemyCatalog`

---

## 2026-07-10 — Docs system adapted from Labyrinth Legends

**Decision:** Adopt LL’s lean documentation taxonomy (Vision → Gameplay → Design → Tech → Asset Bible) without maze/LLDL content.

**Reason:** Keep solo-dev + AI discipline without importing the wrong game.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## 2026-07-10 — Vertical slice: campaign + power-ups + persistence

**Decision:** Ship a playable product path: Home → Twilight Road (5 nodes) → battle → result (coins / unlock) with local profile persistence. Match-4 creates a rocket (row+col blast when matched); match-5+ creates a bomb (3×3).

**Reason:** Move from sandbox stub to a closable 10-minute loop before Phase 2 Balancing Bible.

**Impact:** `assets/levels/twilight_road.json`, campaign screens, `profileProvider` + SharedPreferences, puzzle specials, battle result flow.

**Status:** Accepted — implemented

---

## 2026-07-10 — Shape catalog, four specials, merges

**Decision:** Matches follow the spreadsheet catalog (lines, 2×2, mix-of-five L/T/plus). Specials: V/H rocket, bomb, fireball, seeker (L → seeker; T/plus/2×2 → bomb; H4 → V-rocket; V4 → H-rocket; line5 → fireball). Create at swap destination. Special↔special uses the merge matrix.

**Reason:** Richer match-3 feel; Seeker is the 4th special for L pentominoes.

**Status:** Accepted — implemented

---

## 2026-07-10 — Colorless power-ups, fireball rules, bomb+rocket cross

**Decision:** Power-ups do not participate in color matching. Activate by tap or by swapping with any adjacent tile. Fireball tap clears a random board color; fireball swap clears the swapped tile’s color; cleared power-ups chain. Bomb + V-rocket and bomb + H-rocket both produce the same fat 3×3 cross (3 rows + 3 cols).

**Reason:** Clearer activation UX; fireball feels intentional on swap vs lucky on tap; rocket+bomb should not be direction-dependent.

**Status:** Accepted — implemented

---

## 2026-07-10 — AB1 production standards locked

**Decision:** Adopt [AB1 — Production Standards](../06_Asset_Bible/AB1_Production_Standards.md) for the first art pass: Dusk style board, Leonardo AI + ForgeGUI workflow, stable `{category}_{id}.png` naming, export sizes, and human review checklist.

**Reason:** Lock specs before generating hero/enemy/tile assets so AI output stays consistent and Flutter-ready.

**Impact:** `docs/06_Asset_Bible/AB1_Production_Standards.md`, `assets/images/*` subfolders, style board in `assets/images/style_board/`.

**Status:** Accepted — art *style* superseded by 2026-07-11 chibi battle lock below; naming/sizes/tooling still apply

---

## 2026-07-11 — Art style: chibi battle stage (not painterly busts)

**Decision:** Mythora production art is **chibi / super-deformed 2D** matched to a puzzle-RPG **battle stage**:

- Full-body hero (left) and enemy (right) on the upper battle half
- HP bars stay on/near characters (characters do not replace numbers)
- Puzzle tiles and skill icons share the same thick-outline, soft cel-shaded, glossy “toy” look
- Dusk palette (teal / parchment / amber / ember) remains — not neon, not photoreal
- Collection / roster cards reuse the same full-body sprites (or crops), not a separate semi-real portrait style

**Rejected:** Painterly adult bust portraits as the primary style lock (Leonardo Phoenix text-only drifted cinematic; busts do not stage well above the board).

**Reason:** Future battle UI replaces the flat name/HP header with staged characters; board + characters must be one language. Chibi reads at phone scale and is cheaper to idle/hit-polish later (AB2).

**Impact:** Rewrite [AB1 Production Standards](../06_Asset_Bible/AB1_Production_Standards.md) + [Leonardo Prompt Pack](../06_Asset_Bible/AB1_Leonardo_Prompt_Pack.md); style seed `assets/images/style_board/style_seed_battle_mage.png`; old bust seed deprecated.

**Status:** Accepted

---

## 2026-07-20 — Campaign content architecture (200 levels)

**Decision:** Ship a **200-level** linear campaign stubbed in JSON, structured as **10 chapters × 20 levels**.

| Item | Lock |
|------|------|
| Map UI | Vertical Candy Crush–style path |
| Chapter boss sightings | Levels **5 / 10 / 15 / 20** — same foe, escalating forms; flees until **20** (final death) |
| Level identity | Board rules **and** enemy kits equally |
| Hero unlocks | **4** unlocks across the arc (~every 50 levels); starter Mage available from start |
| Meta prep | Light inventory before boss fights — **Vanguard Tonic**, **Aegis Flask**, **Second Wind** only (v1) |
| Core combat | Unchanged — match → resources/AP → skills; prep does **not** deal boss damage from the puzzle |
| Weekly | Mon–Fri puzzle objectives; weekend extreme bosses; fail spends **life/energy** |
| Home | Hub (not the map); primary CTA **Enter Campaign**; show **lives** from day one |

**Chapter themes (locked names):**

1. Twilight Road  
2. Mistfen Marshes  
3. Howling Ridge  
4. Ashen Quarries  
5. Candlecrypt  
6. Mirror Lake  
7. Thornmarket  
8. Skybridge Siege  
9. Eclipse Forge  
10. Mythspire Gate  

**Reason:** Solo-dev scalable content — reuse enemy art via forms/variants; narrative boss returns; systems over unique-per-level art.

**Impact:** [Content Architecture](../01_Game_Design/Content_Architecture.md), [Master Prompts](../06_Asset_Bible/Master_Prompts.md), future campaign JSON schema, home/weekly/meta-prep features.

**Status:** Accepted

## 2026-07-20 — Board complexity, moves clamp, win condition, enrage

**Decision:**

### Board complexity
- Boards are **data-driven templates + modifiers** (masks, layered obstacles, movers) — not unique art per level.
- **Masked / blocked cells** and layered obstacles roll out from mid-campaign (Ch2+ as content needs).
- **Moving parts** (row/col shove, sliding segments) start in **Chapter 3 — Howling Ridge**, not before.

### Moves budget
```text
movesThisTurn = hero.movesPerTurn
              + prep (e.g. Vanguard Tonic +1)
              + level modifiers
              − boss/level debuffs
```
- Default **minimum clamp = 2**.
- **Nightmare bosses** may clamp as low as **1**.
- Moves still refresh each player turn and do not carry over ([GAMEPLAY](../GAMEPLAY.md)).

### Win / lose (campaign)
- Campaign default: fight until **hero HP ≤ 0** (defeat) or **enemy HP ≤ 0** / boss **flee or death** (victory).
- **No** global “N chances then lose” for campaign.
- Weekly / special nodes may use survive-N-turns or tile objectives.

### Boss enrage
- Optional level flag: after **8 player turns**, boss **enrages** (increased damage / tougher skill weights) — not an instant lose.
- Exact multipliers → Balancing Bible.

**Reason:** Preserve RPG HP fantasy; use moves and board geometry as tactical pressure; introduce movers only when Ch1–2 basics are solid.

**Impact:** [Content Architecture](../01_Game_Design/Content_Architecture.md), [GAMEPLAY](../GAMEPLAY.md), future level JSON (`maskId`, `moverId`, `enrageAfterTurns`, `minMoves`).

**Status:** Accepted
